In 2378, in a parallel universe called Nebulaëris, the Orion System shines like a beacon in the black immensity. It is an oasis of life in a sea of nebulae and dead stars.

You are Kornus, a talented aerospace 
engineer. Your childhood best friend, Thorne, shares your passion for space exploration. You grew up together, 
dreaming of traveling to the stars and discovering the secrets of the universe. But one day, your dream turns
into a nightmare. Thorne is abducted by aliens from the planet XFE-462, a mysterious planet located in the 
Orion System. Your world collapses around you. 

You can't imagine your life without Thorne. 

You are determined to save him, no matter the cost. Using your engineering skills, you build a revolutionary rocket capable of
traveling from planet to planet. It's a crazy bet, a suicide mission, but you're willing to do anything to 
find your friend. Your journey will take you through the dangers of space.  But you will never give up hope.
You know that Thorne is out there somewhere, waiting to be rescued.

## Gameplay

The game is divided into 5 levels, each of which is divided into 2 mini-games:

The first part is a shooting game, like Angry Birds, where the goal is to launch your rocket into a planet's orbit.
